  <p>I study gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters.  In particular,
  I measure the amount that cluster lenses bend background galaxies
  into arcs as a way to measure the small scale variations in the
  distribution of both baryonic and dark matter.  This bending is
  called <i>flexion</i>, and is a quantitative measure of gradients in
  the local lensing convergence and shear fields. Read about my work on flexion
