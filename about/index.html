		<div class="about">
			<h1>Academic Research</h1>
			<p>I attended the University of Wisconsin, graduating in 2004 with
			a B.S. in Physics, Mathematics, and Astronomy. I earned a Ph.D. from
			the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2010 with a thesis on 
			measuring galaxy cluster substructure with gravitational lensing 
			flexion. Since then I have worked at the University of California 
			Davis as a Postdoctoral Scholar (in addition to being a Lecturer - 
			see below).</p>
			<p>My research interests focus around the substructure of dark matter
			haloes. I currently work primarily with deep Hubble Space Telescope
			images of galaxy clusters using public data sets from programs such
			as CLASH and the Hubble Frontier Fields (I am a member of the Bradac
			team in the latter). You can read about my published results 
			<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.08218">here</a> and 
			<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0551">here</a>.</p>
			
			<h1>Teaching</h1>
			<p>I am a passionate educator with a strong background in both 
			physics and astronomy. While at UC Davis, I have been the instructor
			of record for these courses:
			<ul>
				<li>Physics 1A: A one quarter lecture-based classical mechanics
				course aimed at students in agriculture science majors.</li>
				<li>Physics 7A,B,&C: A three quarter laboratory and active-learning
				focused series covering introductory physics and aimed at students
				in biomedical science majors.</li>
				<li>Physics 9A: A one quarter lecture and lab classical mechanics
				course aimed at students in engineering and physics majors.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>I have also, from 2013-2016, been an instructor for the <a 
			href="http://cosmos.ucdavis.edu/">UC Davis COSMOS </a>summer program. 
			Each summer we would lead 20-25 advanced high school students in a 
			month-long immersive astrophysics program. This included courses and 
			independent research projects, field trips, and rooftop observing 
			with small telescopes. In 2016 I was the lead instructor for our 
			astrophysics cluster and oversaw the expansion of our use of 
			professional astronomy software in the program and an increased 
			emphasis on teaching the students programming skills in Python.</p>
			
			<h1>Union Leadership</h1>
			<p>Since April 2011 I have been proud to be an elected member of the  
			statewide Executive Board of the <a href="http://www.uaw5810.org">UC 
			postdoc union - UAW 5810</a>. I served 4 years as the chief Trustee 
			on the board and then became the local unionFinancial Secretary. In
			addition to my specific roles overseeing the union's finances, as a
			leader and activist member I have worked to forward the goals of our
			members. I have been involved in political advocacy on the state and 
			federal levels, worked to build the postdoc community on the UC Davis 
			campus and statewide through union member engagement, and represented
			postdocs in grievances.  As a member of the Executive Board, in 2015
			and 2016, I was a member of the contract bargaining team for the 
			union. Through these two negotiations we successfully negotiated two
			contracts that include groundbreaking expansions of postdoc rights
			and benefits with no concessions.</p>
